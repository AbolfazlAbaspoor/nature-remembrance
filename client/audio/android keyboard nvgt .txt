**Title:**
Android: input boxes do not open or close soft keyboard  

**Description:**  
On Android, focusing an `audio_form` input box does not open the soft keyboard. On Windows this works because of the hardware keyboard, but on Android the IME must be explicitly shown/hidden.  

**Steps to reproduce:**  
1. Create a form with `create_window` and `create_input_box`.  
2. Call `focus(input_id)`.  
3. Run on Android without a hardware keyboard.  
4. Observe: NVGT announces “blank” but the soft keyboard never appears.  

**Expected behavior:**  
- When an input box (or `ct_keyboard_area`) gains focus, Android should automatically open the soft keyboard.  
- When focus is lost or the form is closed/reset, the soft keyboard should hide.  

**Proposed fix:**  
In the Android platform layer, when a `ct_input` or `ct_keyboard_area` control gains focus, call:  
```java
InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager)context.getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
imm.showSoftInput(editText, InputMethodManager.SHOW_IMPLICIT);
```  
When focus is lost or the form closes, call:  
```java
imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(editText.getWindowToken(), 0);
```  

**Why this matters:**  
Without this, Android users cannot type into NVGT input boxes unless they attach a hardware keyboard. Adding IME show/hide handling will make forms usable on Android.
